# Research
This folder contains selected works from the two projects I did as research assistant
1. Control topological phases with quantum light
2. Shift photoconductivity in Haldane model
## Content
- Python code implementation of [Fukui's algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0503172) for Chern number calculation
- Jupyter Notebook of Haldane model demonstration that includes a phase diagram of Haldane model calculated numerically using the Fukui's algorithm
